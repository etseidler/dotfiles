The GitLab Workflow extension integrates GitLab into Visual Studio Code.

If you face an issue, check out our [troubleshooting page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/troubleshooting.html) and if it's not listed, please [report it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues).

## Setup

This extension requires you to create a GitLab personal access token, and assign it to the extension:

1. [Install the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) from the Visual Studio Marketplace and enable it. If you use an unofficial version of VS Code, install the extension from the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/GitLab/gitlab-workflow).
1. To sign in to your GitLab instance, run the command **GitLab: Authenticate**.
   1. Open Visual Studio Code, then open the command palette by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.
   1. In the command palette, search for **GitLab: Authenticate** and press <kbd>Enter<kbd>.
   1. Select your GitLab instance URL from the offered options, or enter one manually.
      - When manually adding an instance to **URL to GitLab instance**, paste the full URL to your
        GitLab instance, including the `http://` or `https://`. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm.
   1. For GitLab.com, you can use the OAuth authentication method.
   1. If you don't use OAuth, use a Personal Access Token to log in.
      - If you have an existing personal access token with `api` scope, select **Enter an existing token** to enter it.
      - If you don't, select **Create a token first**, and the extension opens the PAT settings page for you.
        If this method fails, follow the instructions [in the GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token).
   1. Copy the token. _For security reasons, this value is never displayed again, so you must copy this value now._
   1. Paste in your GitLab personal access token and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The token is not displayed, nor is it accessible to others.

The extension automatically matches your Git repository remote URL with the GitLab instance URL you specified for your token. If you have multiple accounts or projects, you can choose the one you want to use. For more information, see [Switch GitLab accounts in VS Code](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/#switch-gitlab-accounts-in-vs-code).

The extension is ready to use. If your project has a pipeline for the last commit, and a merge request from your current branch, information about both is displayed in the Visual Studio Code status bar.

### Commands and extension settings

For a full list of GitLab commands you can run from the VS Code Command Palette, see:

- [Command Palette commands](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/settings.html#command-palette-commands).
